Helping people
Naturally, I am an anxious and neurotic personality.  However, every once in a while, my abilities, availability, and performance can drastically change my paycheck. While this seems like common sense, the issue is that my fiancé has been sent off to the navy, and I have been tasked with trying to either get the highest raise possible, or become a manager while he is away.  Because my life can get pretty hectic and unpredictable, and my emotional instability coupled with the absence of my fiancé, can deal some pretty heavy tolls on me. I just want to make sure I can get this next raise...
